"""Variables is a way of stroring data and use it later on in

it assigns type automatically."""

# Variable definition
#one = 1
#two = 2
#three = 3

# The above variable definition can also be defined as follows:
one, two, three = 1, 2, 3

# Printing variables using the print function
print(one)
print(two)
print(three)

#Modifying the "two" variable to 4
two = 4

print(two)
print(one)

# Defining decimals (float)
Decimal = 1.1
print(Decimal)

# Defining String variable
StringVar = "Hello"
print(StringVar)

"""All the variables created above are global variables, 
meaning they can be accessed from anywhere in the program."""
